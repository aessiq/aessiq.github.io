I did it a long time ago, so the quality of the code pretty shitty but it was my biggest pure HTML/CSS/JS project. It has:

- multiple pages,
- modals (click on Log In or Sign Up), with switchable tabs, 
- SVG masking, custom border shape with animations (these animations don't look great, but it was stated in design docs),
- JS carousels (by click and automatic),
- drag & drop map with zooming,
- work with localStorage - you can like the video on "Zoos" page and choose another one by clicking on it - videos will switch and your like is stored in localStorage, you can check it by selecting liked video again.
