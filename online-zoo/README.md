Website for online-zoo (not real, training purpose only).

I did it a long time ago, so the quality of the code pretty shitty but it is my biggest project. It has:

- multiple pages, all responsible (almost, carousels work purely on small window sizes),
- modals (click on Log In or Sign Up), with switchable tabs, done with pure JS, 
- SVG masking, custom border shape with animations (IMHO these animations don't look great, but it was stated in desdocs),
- JS carousels (by button and automatic),
- drag & drop map with zooming,
- work with localStorage - you can like the video on "Zoos" page and choose another one by clicking on it - videos will switch and your like is stored in localStorage, you can check it by selecting liked video again.
