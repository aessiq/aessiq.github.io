                <p class="blogpost__text">For the last few days I have been doing the last task in the first block of
                    the programming course. Finally, a small three-page website about myself is ready and I think it
                    looks pretty nice. In general, despite the fact that I have known the basics of HTML and CSS, I have
                    not done any of it for a long time, so I repeated all the basics again.<br>Also, here is an
                    interesting video i found recently: </p>

                <p class="blogpost__text">I havenâ€™t been programming for several months, but I received a letter in the
                    mail - 50% discount on online courses. Of the entire list, I liked only the ITMO's course, so I
                    submitted my documents and paid it. <br>
                    Most likely I already know some part of the material, but I haven't studied it for a long time and
                    forgot a lot, but there is also something new - PHP and MySQL. <br>
                    In the future, I want to create a portfolio site, like the one on the video:</p>

                <p class="blogpost__text">Sadly, I felt that I could not cope and lost the desire to program at all.
                    Despite the fact that the job of a developer was very close, I decided to take a break and find out
                    if I like programming in general.</p>

                <p class="blogpost__text">For the last three months I have been taking evening courses from EPAM - the
                    material, of course, was presented very briefly, thesis, I was lucky that I already knew something
                    before the courses. I had to learn React from scratch, struggled for almost a week on the final
                    task, barely managed to pass it and passed an interview. A couple of days later, I found out that I
                    got on an internship.</p>
