Photofilter as it is.
You can blur, invert, sepia, saturate and hue rotate an image and you can reset the changes.
There is a default gallery of 20 pics, you can change them by clicking "Next picture". Also pictures depend on the time of the day (pics of the night in the night, morning - in the morning, etc.).
Also it is possible to upload your pic from PC, edit it and then save.
